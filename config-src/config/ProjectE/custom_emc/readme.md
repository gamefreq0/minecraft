Step 1 - extract recipes
------------------------

There's a crafttweaker function in `main.zs` for this. Take the text output from the `crafttweaker.log` and remove the prefixes. `\[\d\d:\d\d:\d\d.\d\d\d\]\[DONE\]\[CLIENT\]\[INFO\]`. Save as `recipes.yaml` (This is ignored by git because it's going to be like 40 mb.)

Step 2 - write config
---------------------
If nothing else, this is either in the repo or an example is. No help here, sorry.
