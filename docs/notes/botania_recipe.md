I forget the item name. It lets you absorb items into a pendant, but only items
of one type.

Anyway, we had discussed what the requirements to get it are. Normally you'd
need a material gated behind the botania boss, but I wanted it to be easier.

I decided that I wanted plants that would encourage the player to go to
different places in the world, including the nether, but did not want The End as
part of the requirements.

Which mostly meant that the only "real" issue is that I have to figure out what
plants.

From Botania, I wanted four plants. I decided ink colors - CMYK - Cyan, Magenta,
yellow, and black - would make a thematic set just fine. So that became the set
from botania:

```
botania:cyan_mystical_flower
botania:magenta_mystical_flower
botania:yellow_mystical_flower
botania:black_mystical_flower
```

Other biomes are a bit harder. I think we can make people go to deserts/dry
biomes pretty easily.

```
minecraft:cactus
```

And water biomes aren't hard either

```
minecraft:kelp
```

Underground presents another easy

```
minecraft:cave_root
```

And the nether is another easy-enough

```
minecraft:warped_fungus
```

Some talk was had about making there be alternative options for the slots where
there'd definitely be other plants in the biome - all the cactuses we have,
maybe there's something else underwater, both versions of cave roots, and the
other type of fungus from the nether.

That gives us a box of items in the crafting table, regardless. I've not
decided what I want in the middle but I think it's just going to be a decent
amount of EMC. That means fuels from Project E, diamond blocks, etc are the
goto items here. Most likely I'll settle for fuels from Project E.

The motivation to a large quantity of EMC is pretty straight forward: I want
players to obtain the item after playing the game for some time, and this causes
a delay quite forcefully.

Of course, these assumptions about travel and playing the game only remain
relatively bulletproof in a single-player environment...
