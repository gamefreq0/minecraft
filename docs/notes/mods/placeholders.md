# Placeholders

Objects meant to be modified via datapack and NBT tagging. So their designs are
semi-meaningless.

## Block

Mostly meant to be replaced with models, figures, dolls, etc

### 1t1w1d

Those only one block in size.

#### Decoration

Intended for Statics.

#### Game Piece

Literally just meant for game board pieces that only span one block in size

#### Game Tile

Similar thing. Game tiles that span one block in size.

#### Figure

General term for a model.

#### Doll

Typical of servers, really, to have dolls.

## Tokens

Several things eiher sucked or were open to abuse, so they were changed. In
general, tokens exist to defuse the effects of luck and to defuse the effects
of EMC usage.

### Kill Token

Some items are related to a number of dead enemies, like banners in Terraria.
In order to establish a market, it was necessary to create a token.

Each enemy death should be worth one kill token. Autolooting is good here - we
want the player who got the kill to get the token.

### Loot Token

Similar to Kill Tokens, we want a system where you can just buy an item. The
value of Loot Token market items is expressed as 1 over some number, where
"some number" is the price for the item. When in doubt, lean harder, not easier;
the players are now guaranteed to not have to beat the RNG, so they can
definitely spend time beating the enemies. We made grinding fair. We didn't
promise to eliminate it entirely.

### Unobtainable Token

Some items were removed from the game, but recipes still call for them. This
exists to represent those items without being them.

This should not be confused with the item placeholder, which exists to represent
an item with no stat needs.

## Tool
Literally just placeholder for their item types. That's it.

* Pickaxe
* Axe
* Sword
* Shovel
* Hoe
* Shears

### Paxel

A paxel is a Pickaxe combined with an axe combined with a shovel.

## The rest

### Crafting Intermediary

The kind of item that does nothing itself, but is needed to craft something that
does do something.

Ingots, anyone?

### Currency

There needed to be a way to exchange things by externalizing them from the EMC
system, basically. Placeholder currency solves this problem and many other
purely-currency related problems.
