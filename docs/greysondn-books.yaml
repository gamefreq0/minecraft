    title: To Write
    lore: The decision is made to write books to put into the world
    text: >-
        I decided that perhaps it'd be interesting to scatter books around that
        have some record of the development of this pack and server. I don't
        often talk about things very loudly, even to people who rely on me for
        what I'm doing, and I thought, well, this would be interesting.
        
        Else Heart.break() did a similar thing, incidentally. In that world,
        you'd find text documents that looked like things people had saved to
        their computers and then discarded - scratch files for code, random
        thoughts, entire manuals. So don't feel like I'm being original.

    title: Work's Magnitude
    lore: The overwhelming nature of the work itself
    text: >-
        I'm a very disorganized person. No matter how many lists I make or how I
        try to line the pieces up, I always forget something. So. For everything
        I realize there is to do, there's an entry in a notebook, usually one
        line, that I strike as I do it.
        
        Some of these things are easy.
        
        Removing an item - or at least removing recipes and marking it forbidden
        in game - is one line of code in crafttweaker. I look up the id and just
        plug it into a function I've written. At worst, I need to copy a file
        and make sure it gets called in main - three very straightforward
        operations.
        
        Most of these things are hard.
        
        Unifying ores? Well, several mods don't like to cooperate with
        Crafttweaker, so I have to write code to do those mods still... then I
        have to adjust the drop tables from the native versions of those ores
        which is a datapack thing, which means opening the mod and finding their
        drops and copying them out and doing a commit of the stock thing so we
        can see the changes. And then I have to test to make sure the drops are
        working correctly because I can never get the fiddly, stupid thing to
        work.
        
        And I have an entire page and a half that's nothing but ore and ingot
        unification notes.
        
        Craft-Vania is poorly documented and I have to test half the things in
        it, plus we need to adjust durabilities (how do I even?!?) so that the
        items in it aren't basically free compared to vanilla. So that's most of
        another page.
        
        We've got chest loot modifiers that weren't data driven in their
        original packs, so in order to remove forbidden items from chests -
        because god knows I'll scream the first time Dreaming goes "why did I
        get a forbidden item" - we have to find some method that ISN'T a data
        pack.
        
        I've got a custom hud going via RPG hud which is great and all, very
        aesthetic, very nice with Scaling Health running at the same time,
        except I've yet to do the mount GUI and I've no clue what half the
        regions in it do anyway. So nature forbid someone will get an effect I
        didn't test and then complain that their status bar went black with an
        outline.
        
        Nobody in our group has ever done Mekanism or Create, so I have to just
        play with those and get a feel for them so that players have someone
        that can help them. Each of those has a deep progression from start to
        end and I'm really just gawking at the time investment wondering what
        I was thinking even making a fully done modpack like this.
        
        And then there's documentation. The guidebook doesn't write itself and
        players need documentation that doesn't include things they're not
        allowed to have to begin with.
        
        I have no clue what I was thinking, honestly. Because there's still
        other things I can list out and we've not even gotten started. And this
        is already two years overdue that my life stole from me.
        
        And then there will be requests to update it to the latest version of
        minecraft later on. And half the mods will not have been updated.
        
        And it's like 200 mods so loading into the world is like a five minute
        thing just to find out I forgot another semi-colon in a CraftTweaker
        script because WOOPSIE DOOPSIE I'M A PYTHON PROGRAMMER AND WE DON'T NEED
        SEMICOLONS.
        
        What was I thinking? WHAT WAS I THINKING?!?
